### A Brief Overview: IDU Firmware Updates & TR-069

Let‚Äôs keep it concise.

Yes, firmware behaviour varies slightly across models‚Äîeach may use different binaries for updating.  
**Key point**: check your IDU and inspect the `/tmp` directory. If you find files named `jioCwmpLog` there, you're in luck.

These files log **unencrypted commands and URLs** sent over-the-air to the IDU during firmware updates.  
We leverage these logs to capture relevant data whenever the ACS pushes an update.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep in Mind

- You **cannot force** the ACS to push firmware unless it has already been uploaded and made available for download by the CPE.
- You **can** periodically pull the log to a separate location.
- Optionally, implement a script to **drop the ACS connection** by modifying firewall rules as soon as a firmware URL prefix like: http://fota.slv.kai.jiophone.net/5G/ is detected in the log.

There are experimental approaches too‚Äîsuch as injecting a modified `libssl` to decrypt HTTPS traffic.  
While the modified `libssl` is ready, this method is overkill for now :)

## ODU Side (Outdoor Unit)

The ODU communicates with the ACS similarly and stores unencrypted TR-069/CWMP logs on its filesystem.  
However, **without shell access**‚Äîwhich is restricted on most ODUs‚Äîthis data isn't easily accessible.

For those with **root shell access**, ACS links can be extracted.

#### üîç Log Files (Located in `/data`)

- `tr69_stack.log`  
- `tr69data.log`  

üìÅ These files contain **plaintext TR-069 communication data**.

#### üîÑ Manually Restart TR-069 on the ODU

1. Find the PID of the TR-069 process:

 ```sh
 ps aux | grep -e tr
```

2. Kill it 
```shell
 kill -9 <PID>
```

3. Restart Tr069 client
```shell
/usr/bin/tr69_ctrl /usr/bin/tr69c
```

### Understanding the URL Formats

- `/5G/` ‚Äî constant segment; appears in all URLs.
- `/UDI/` ‚Äî stands for **IDU** firmware (Indoor Unit).
- `/UDO/` ‚Äî stands for **ODU** firmware (Outdoor Unit).
- `/DIN520/` ‚Äî indicates the ODU variant; "520" typically matches the beginning of the ODU model number.
- `/A1402_32_S/` ‚Äî firmware version:
  - `2_32_S` is the actual version.
  - `A140` encodes part of the model in reverse ‚Äî e.g., `A140` ‚Üí `041A`, which hints at model suffix like `52041`.
- `/Sxxxxxxx.img` ‚Äî the actual firmware file:
  - File name usually starts with `S`, followed by a seemingly random string (likely hashed or auto-generated).




## TR-069 Communication ‚Äì IDU

### üõ†Ô∏è Server Configuration

- **ACS Server**: `https://acs.oss.jio.com:8443/ftacs-digest/ACS`
  - To find your ACS server, check:
    - `/etc/cpestate-default.xml` ‚Äì (in SSH-enabled IDU)
    - `/rom/etc/cpestate-default.xml` ‚Äì (alternate path)
    - `/etc/keep/config.save` ‚Äì (from firmware backup)
- **Communication Port**: `7547` (TCP)
- **Authentication**: HTTPS with Digest Authentication

---

### üîÅ Initial Connection

- Device sends **periodic inform messages** every 24 hours.
- Connection settings stored in:
  - `/etc/cpestate-default.xml`
- **TR-069 client binary**:
  - `/sbin/cwmpc`
- Includes key device info:
  - Model, serial number, firmware version
- Secured via **HTTPS Digest Authentication**

---

### üì¶ Device Information Sent

> Collected from various system files:

- **Model name**: `/tmp/deviceModel`
- **Manufacturer**: `/tmp/mfgName`
- **Serial number**: `/tmp/deviceSerial`
- **Hardware version**: `/tmp/hwVersion`
- **Software version**: (current firmware version)
- **OUI**: First 6 characters of MAC address

---

## üì• Firmware Download Process

### 1. üîî Update Notification

- ACS server detects available firmware and sends a `Download` RPC.
- RPC contains:
  - Firmware download URL
  - Signature file URL
  - Auth credentials (if required)
  - File size information
- All communication is encrypted via **HTTPS**

---

### 2. ‚¨áÔ∏è Download Phase

- TR-069 client (`/sbin/cwmpc`) receives the `Download` RPC.
- Downloads:
  - Firmware to `/tmp/firmware.img`
  - Signature to `/tmp/firmware.sig`
- **These filenames are mandatory** for the upgrade process.
- Files are verified for:
  - **Integrity**
  - **Completeness**

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Validation Phase

```sh
/sbin/jioSysMethods.sh validate /tmp/firmware.img /tmp/firmware.sig <TRIGGER_SOURCE>
```

- Valid trigger sources:
    - `GUI`: For web interface-triggered upgrades
    - `ACS`: For TR-069 / Auto Configuration Server-triggered upgrades
    - `PLATFORM`: For system/platform-triggered upgrades
    - `PLUME`: For Plume mesh-triggered upgrades


- Performs:
	- File existence and name checks
    - Cryptographic signature validation
    - Device compatibility verification

### 4. üîêCryptographic Verification 

- Uses `/usr/bin/jcrypt upgrade` for verification 
- Takes 3 parameters: 
	- Device model (from `/tmp/deviceModel`) 
	- Signature file path 
	- Firmware image path 
- Verification is model-specific 
- Uses asymmetric cryptography: 
	- Private key held by FW-maker 
	- Public key embedded in device 
	- Signature is created with private key 
	- Verification is done with public key

### 5.üóÉÔ∏è File needed to be present during a fw upgrade
- Firmware image: `/tmp/firmware.img` 
- Signature file: `/tmp/firmware.sig`
- Device model: `/tmp/deviceModel` 
- Hardware version: `/tmp/hwVersion` 
- Manufacturer: `/tmp/mfgName` 
- Serial number: `/tmp/deviceSerial`
